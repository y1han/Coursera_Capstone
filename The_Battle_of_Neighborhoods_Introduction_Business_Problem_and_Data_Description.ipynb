    "## Introduction/Business Problem\n",
    "Let's say if I want to open a *Chinese restaurant* in New York city. I have no idea about where or which **neighborhood** is proper to open the restaurant.  \n",
    "I have to build a model to get some recommendations of where to start my business.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "  Therefore, we will use Scikit-learn's **Regression** method to train and predict the number of *Chinese restaurant* in a neighborhood by providing the venues information of NYC. Venues information is discoverd from [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/) API. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  It's common to know that a location with many restaurants of a particular type indicates the most favorable flavor that the customers there want. So I think it's safe to say that a location with more Chinese restaurant means a more reliable location to start the business. Also, other factors like price and number of comment might be helpful too.\n",
    " \n",
    "  The neighborhood information is based on the data provided by NYU, here is the link: https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The pre-configured json file provided by this course can be downloaded here: https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I will build model and compare with existing number of *Chinese restaurant*. Thus finding a potential place to start my business!"
